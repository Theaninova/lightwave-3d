/// (Introduced with LightWaveÂ® 6.5.) Associates a set of floating-point vectors with the vertices
/// of specific polygons. VMADs are similar to VMAPs, but they assign vectors to polygon vertices
/// rather than points. For a given mapping, a VMAP always assigns only one vector to a point, while
/// a VMAD can assign as many vectors to a point as there are polygons sharing the point.
///
/// The motivation for VMADs is the problem of seams in UV texture mapping. If a UV map is
/// topologically equivalent to a cylinder or a sphere, a seam is formed where the opposite edges of
/// the map meet. Interpolation of UV coordinates across this discontinuity is aesthetically and
/// mathematically incorrect. The VMAD substitutes an equivalent mapping that interpolates
/// correctly. It only needs to do this for polygons in which the seam lies.
///
/// VMAD chunks are paired with VMAPs of the same name, if they exist. The vector values in the VMAD
/// will then replace those in the corresponding VMAP, but only for calculations involving the
/// specified polygons. When the same points are used for calculations on polygons not specified in
/// the VMAD, the VMAP values are used.
///
/// VMADs need not be associated with a VMAP. They can also be used simply to define a
/// (discontinuous) per-polygon mapping. But not all mapping types are valid for VMADs, since for
/// some types it makes no sense for points to have more than one map value. TXUV, RGB, RGBA and
/// WGHT types are supported for VMADs, for example, while MORF and SPOT are not. VMADs of
/// unsupported types are preserved but never evaluated.
